# LLMNR Poisoning

## Description
**LLMNR** is an acronym for Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution. It is a name resolution protocol or service used on windows environments. Its purpose is to resolve the IP address of a host situated on the identical local network in instances where the DNS server is not accessible. 

It works by sending the request to all the devices across the network requesting a specific host name. It does this, using a **name resolution request packet**.

It broadcasts that packet to all the devices on the network, and if there is a device with that host name, it will respond with the **name resolution response packet**. This packet contains its IP address and then the connection will be established with the requesting device.

## How LLMNR poisoning works

Lets say, a user or victim is requesting for any shared drive or folder. The problem here is that, the DNS can't connect to that shared drive because it does not even exist.

So the server replies back saying that the victim cannot connect to that resource. Now the victim multicasts that request to the entire network, in case any other user on the network knows the root to the shared drive.

You can observe in the diagram below, how the victim is multicasting his request to the enitre network. The victim does not know that the attacker is also connected to the network.

Now the attacker will spoof himself as an authorized user and respond back to the victims request with a **name resolution packet** saying that he knows the root of that resource, and asks the victim for his username and hash.

And this is how LLMNR poisoning works.
