# LLMNR Poisoning

## Description
**LLMNR** is an acronym for Link-Local Multicast Name Resolution. It is a name resolution protocol or service used on windows environments. Its purpose is to resolve the IP address of a host situated on the identical local network in instances where the DNS server is not accessible. 

It works by sending the request to all the devices across the network requesting a specific host name. It does this, using a **name resolution request packet**.

It broadcasts that packet to all the devices on the network, and if there is a device with that host name, it will respond with the **name resolution response packet**. This packet contains its IP address and then the connection will be established with the requesting device.
